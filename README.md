# Hierarchical Graph Matching Network —— Classification Dataset
This is the dataset for classification task in Hierarchical Graph Matching Network paper ([link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkeqn1rtDH)).

To use these data, please download files in this repository and put it to appropriate place which is mentioned in our released codes.

CFGs of ffmpeg are derived directly from binaries compiled from source code on the official website([link](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)). As for OpenSSL, we filtered the original CFG data from this [repo](https://github.com/xiaojunxu/dnn-binary-code-similarity) and got these sub-datasets files for experiments.

For regression dataset, please refer to https://github.com/yunshengb/SimGNN
